# Magikards React
A card game where you battle your friends for glory! Choose from Fire or Ice archetypes: Fire is more offensive while Ice is defensive. 

## This project is a work in progress. It currently runs, but not as intended. New features will be added over time while also squashing bugs along the way.


## This project currently only runs on local machines. A future update will include the ability to connect with other players online. For now, the game runs with both players playing from the same machine. 

In the terminal, navigate to the project file after downloading and type:
### `npm i`

This will install the necessary dependencies. After all files have downloaded, run the game by typing 

### `npm start`

If nothing pops up in your browser, you can type `localhost:3000` in the address bar to play. 
**Warning: in its current state, the game does not work as intended, this is open to the public as a showcase for now. **
